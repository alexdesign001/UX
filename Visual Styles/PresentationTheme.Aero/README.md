## Additional Tools

This repository also contains several tools for Windows Visual Style files (.msstyles):

1. UxThemeEx: Provides many [Visual Style functions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773178.aspx)
   from uxtheme.dll with the ability to draw native controls using a specific
   .msstyles file. Not intended for general use as it is quite fragile and may
   break if certain Windows components are updated.
2. ThemeBrowser: Allows viewing and comparing .msstyles files. It also provides
   helpful utilities to inspect images and recreate those with WPF paths.

3. ThemePreviewer: Provides previews and comparisons of built-in controls using
   Windows and WPF themes.
