/* This sample demonstrates usage of dynamically populated TREELIST control.
 * The technique allows to have huge tree hiearchies without eating enormous
 * amounts of memory.
 *
 * The example implements a viewer into the system registry, allocating
 * data only for items for registry keys and values of expanded nodes only.
