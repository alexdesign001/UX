/**
 * @file
 * @brief Image view control (@c MC_WC_IMGVIEW).
 *
 * Image view control is specialized control for displaying an image. Unlike
 * the standard @c STATIC control which can only support bitmaps and icons,
 * the image view control supports more image formats: BMP, ICON, GIF, JPEG,
 * PNG, TIFF, WMF and EMF.
 *
 * @attention The chart control requires @c GDIPLUS.DLL version 1.0 or newer to
 * work correctly. See @ref sec_dll_deps for more info.
 *
 *
 * @section sect_imgview_creation Control Creation
 *
 * The control can display images loaded from a file as well as images embedded
 * as resources in a DLL or EXE module. Note that window text as passed into
 * @c CreateWindow() is interpreted as a name of a resource in the same module
 * as specified by the @ HMODULE handle passed into the function. It may also
 * specify the integer ID of a resource with the @c MAKEINTRESOURCE, or in the
 * form "#123".
 *
 * This allows to create the control and associate an image directly in the
 * resource script:
 * @code
 * 50 RCDATA path/to/image1.png
 * 51 RCDATA path/to/image2.jpg
 * "imgname" RCDATA path/to/image3.bmp
 *
 * IDD_DIALOG DIALOG 100, 100, 74, 150
 * STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU | DS_MODALFRAME
 * EXSTYLE WS_EX_DLGMODALFRAME
 * CAPTION "mCtrl Example: IMGVIEW Control"
 * FONT 8, "MS Shell Dlg"
 * BEGIN
 *     CONTROL 50, IDC_IMGVIEW_PNG, MC_WC_IMGVIEW, 0, 7, 7, 16, 16, WS_EX_STATICEDGE
 *     CONTROL "#51", IDC_IMGVIEW_PNG, MC_WC_IMGVIEW, 0, 30, 7, 16, 16, WS_EX_STATICEDGE
 *     CONTROL "imgname", IDC_IMGVIEW_PNG, MC_WC_IMGVIEW, 0, 51, 7, 16, 16, WS_EX_STATICEDGE
 * END
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note the control only looks for image resources of the following resource
 * types: @c RT_RCDATA, @c RT_BITMAP (bitmaps only), "PNG" (PNG only) or @c RT_HTML.
 * (The last option is the application uses the image also with the
 * @c MC_WC_HTML control).
 *
 *
 * @section sect_imgview_setting Setting the Image
 *
 * It is also possible to set the image in the application run time.
 *
 * Use message @ref MC_IVM_LOADRESOURCE to set the image from the resource
 * of a DLL or EXE module. Note the application is responsible to ensure
 * the module is not unloaded while the image is in use by the control
 * I.e. until the control is associated with different image, or until the
 * control is destroyed.
 *
 * To load the image from a file, use the message @ref MC_IVM_LOADFILE.
 *
 *
 * @section sect_imgview_scaling Image Scaling
 *
 * By default, the image is scaled so that its aspect ratio is preserved,
 * and as much of the control area is utilized as possible.
 *
 * Application can change this behavior by specifying the style
 * @ref MC_IVS_REALSIZECONTROL, which scales the image to the size of the
 * control without preserving the aspect ratio; or by the style
 * @ref MC_IVS_REALSIZEIMAGE which suppresses the scaling altogether.
