/**
 * @file
 * @brief Expand control (@c MC_WC_EXPAND).
 *
 * The expand control is a utility control used to toggle size of another window
 * between &quot;collapsed&quot; and &quot;expanded&quot; states.
 *
 * In addition, when collapsing, the control automatically disables and hides
 * all child windows of the managed window which fall out of the visible area;
 * and when expanding it enables and shows all the child windows revealed by the
 * resize operation. Application can disable this behavior with the style
 * @ref MC_EXS_IGNORECHILDREN.
 *
 *
 * @section Managed Window
 *
 * By default the managed window is a parent window of the control. Use message
 * @c CCM_SETNOTIFYWINDOW to change what window the control manages.
 *
 * @note The root control also gets all the notifications from the control.
 *
 *
 * @section Expanded and Collapsed Sizes
 *
 * If both width and height the of the expanded and/or collapsed sizes is zero,
 * the control computes automatically from analyzes of position and size of
 * all child windows of the managed window (usually the parent).
 *
 * The width of the managed window is kept unchanged in this automatic regime.
 * The height of the managed window is calculated so that all child windows
 * of the managed window are visible (the expanded state) or all child windows
 * positioned below the expand control itself are hidden (the collapsed state).
 *
 * If you use style @ref MC_EXS_CACHESIZES, the computed sizes are retained
 * for next use, i.e. the sizes are computed only once.
 *
 * You can set expanded and collapsed sizes explicitly with message
 * @ref MC_EXM_SETCOLLAPSEDSIZE and @ref MC_EXM_SETEXPANDEDSIZE respectively.
 *
 *
 * @section Initial State
 *
 * After creation of the control, its logical state is collapsed. Though
 * the control does not resize the dialog because it may not be already fully
 * initialized, e.g. if the expand control is not last control created in the
 * dialog.
 *
 * Therefore it is supposed that application explicitly sends the message
 * @ref MC_EXM_EXPAND after the dialog and all its children are created,
 * usually as part of the @c WM_INITDIALOG handling.
 *
 *
 * These standard messages are handled by the control:
 * - @c WM_GETFONT
 * - @c WM_SETFONT
 * - @c WM_SETREDRAW
 * - @c CCM_SETNOTIFYWINDOW
 *
 * These standard notifications are sent by the control:
 * - @c NM_OUTOFMEMORY
 * - @c NM_RELEASEDCAPTURE
